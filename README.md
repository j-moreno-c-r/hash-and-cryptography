Tools about criptography and hashs signatures etc.
First create a venv:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
activate this
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Clone the repo.
Enter in the repo with 
```bash
cd hash-and-cryptography
```
in the terminal type
```bash
ls
```
Choice the tool you want to test
```bash
cd "name of the toool"
```
install the dependencies 
```bash
pip install -r requeirements.txt
```
and run it
```bash
python main.py
```
To install correctly the diabolical tkinter on you env use in the hash-and-cryptography directory:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
obs: the second version of the zenitpolar tool is in beta for now...
